First, Research Current Skills in Demand: Begin by working backwards from the competencies employers are seeking—using AI tools to analyze job postings, future-of-work reports, and societal needs—to identify the most critical skills students must master 
.

Next, Design AI-Enhanced Tasks: Move beyond traditional assessments by crafting authentic, open-ended assignments that require students to apply knowledge in real-world contexts. Leverage AI to brainstorm scenarios, embed constraints, and encourage creative problem-solving—ensuring tasks remain challenging for both humans and machines
.

The third step, Support Learners’ Development, focuses on scaffolding students’ growth through personalized instruction. Use AI to generate adaptive learning paths, create multi-sensory content (text, audio, visuals), and deploy AI teaching assistants for just-in-time guidance, fostering a more engaging and inclusive learning environment
.

Fourth, Provide Efficient Feedback: Streamline the feedback loop with AI-powered grading rubrics and automated, yet meaningful, comments on student work. Incorporate formative checkpoints that guide revisions, promote reflection, and help students develop metacognitive skills without overwhelming the instructor
.

Finally, Iterate & Improve: Adopt an iterative mindset—regularly gather data on student performance, collect feedback, and refine both your curriculum and your use of AI tools. This continual cycle of assessment and adjustment ensures your course remains future-ready and responsive to new developments in technology and pedagogy
.

By following these five steps—Research, Design, Support, Feedback, and Iterate—educators can transform their courses in as little as 24 hours, creating dynamic, AI-enhanced learning experiences that prepare students for an AI-driven future.
